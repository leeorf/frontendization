# Frontendization

The idea of the project is to solve the problem of not having a single source of truth for frontend projects at your company.

Have you ever had a hard time trying to figure out what tools the company uses, what patterns it follows, or if the company has some design system or guideline elsewhere?

The idea is to inspire and serve as a guide to spread reusable packages, documentation, onboarding and anything else that can help people build frontend without all headaches that follows every new frontend project.

Ideally, instead of this `README.md` you would have a [`README.md` like this](./docs/README.md) at the root of your project.
